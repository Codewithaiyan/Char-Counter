🧮 Character Counter Application

A full-stack web application that counts the number of characters in a user’s input text.
The app is built using Flask (Python) for the backend and HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend.
It is fully containerized with Docker and deployable to Kubernetes for scalability and production readiness.

📖 Overview

This project demonstrates a simple but production-style microservice setup:

The backend handles requests and performs logic (counting characters, validation, response formatting).

The frontend is a clean, interactive UI where the user enters their text.

Both are Dockerized and deployed as independent services on Kubernetes — communicating via internal service names.

This design mimics real-world DevOps workflows, focusing on containerization, deployment automation, and scalability.
